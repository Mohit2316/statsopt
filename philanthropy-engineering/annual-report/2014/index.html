          <p>These smallholder farmers must contend not only with poverty but also with the pests, diseases, and weather that threaten their crops, livestock, and livelihoods.</p>
          <p>Grameen Foundation uses Palantir to understand how on-the-ground mobile agriculture programs can most effectively improve food security and alleviate poverty for smallholder farmers around the world. Using a mobile application, Grameen Foundation surveys farmers on their needs and agricultural practices and uses Palantir to help farmers improve their circumstances.</p>
          <p>Nearly 2 million mobile interactions with more than 200,000 farmers have been integrated into Palantir alongside economic, demographic, and environmental data, enabling Grameen Foundation to understand and respond to farmers’ individual needs.</p>
          <p>In Uganda and Colombia, Grameen Foundation uses Palantir to transform this raw data into actionable insights. Analysts can determine the farming practices that correspond to the best outcomes for farmers and produce tailored, data-driven farm management plans. Grameen Foundation is also leveraging Palantir to explore novel use cases, including early warning systems for localized disease and pest outbreaks, and connecting farmers to microloans for farm improvement projects.</p>

          <p>Because of an inefficient housing match process that involves multiple government agencies and non-profits, these veterans often remain homeless while waiting for housing for as long as 300 days.</p>
          <p>Palantir has partnered with Community Solutions to develop Homelink, a web application that streamlines the case management process to quickly match veterans to housing within a single, scalable platform. Through Homelink’s San Francisco and Nashville 2014 pilot programs, Palantir has enabled our government and non-profit partners to cut through bureaucratic hurdles and easily collaborate to house homeless veterans across their communities.</p>
          <p>Palantir incorporates an algorithm developed by Community Solutions that automatically matches veterans’ needs with the eligibility criteria for different housing providers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-12">
          <p>Intake surveys form the basis of client profiles, aggregating the data necessary for Homelink to match individuals with the housing assets available to them. As surveys are entered, Homelink generates a vulnerability score for each client so coordinators can understand who needs the most immediate attention.</p>
          <p>In 2015, we aim to reduce the length of the average housing placement process to 60 days, expand to chronically homeless populations in addition to veterans, and introduce Homelink to multiple additional cities across the United States.</p>

          <p>Not only are these criminal syndicates responsible for the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of elephants, but they are also inextricably linked to regional conflict, political corruption, and organized crime.</p>
          <p>C4ADS uses Palantir to identify complex intercontinental networks of traffickers, financiers, and businesses that enable the illicit ivory trade. Palantir provides a unified analytical platform for C4ADS’ global wildlife crime database, allowing analysts to investigate and combat the illegal killing of elephants and the worldwide trafficking of ivory and other illicit environmental goods.</p>
          <p>Using Palantir, C4ADS has mapped the flow of illicit ivory from its origins in Africa to destinations in Southeast Asia, identifying common trafficking routes, links between logistics coordinators and terrorist networks, and government agents who profit from wildlife trafficking.</p>
          <p>By providing authorities with data-driven investigations that shine light on major ivory trafficking syndicates, C4ADS and a consortium of 50 local non-profits, government agencies, and private sector allies have made major strides in combating these illicit networks and their globally devastating effects. For example, in 2014 East African authorities were able to identify a suspicious shipment, leading to the seizure of $11 million in illicitly traded environmental goods, one of the largest environmental crime seizures in African history.</p>
