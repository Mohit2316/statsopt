			<h2>Palantir Philanthropy Engineering in 2013</h2>
			<p>We believe that with good data and the right technology, people working together can change the world for the better. In 2013, our philanthropic partners vindicated this belief time and again. They revolutionized humanitarian response efforts from Tornado Alley to the Philippines, found and helped victims of the modern slave trade, exposed arms trafficking in conflict zones, and increased our understanding of how we can better serve our nation's veterans. We're proud to share the stories of what we accomplished together this year.

				<h2>Operation Greased Lightning<br />Far Rockaway, New York</h2>
				<p>In October 2012 Superstorm Sandy killed more than 250 people and left $60B in damages. A 25 year-old Palantir engineer from Egypt (who had been shot by a rubber bullet in Tahrir Square) sat in a freezing Brooklyn warehouse to optimize Palantir Gotham for our partner <a href="http://teamrubiconusa.org/">Team Rubicon</a> so they could dispatch volunteers where they were needed most. 14,000 spontaneous volunteers were mobilized and efficiently distributed where they could do the most good.</p>

				<p>What had to be done first? Muck out a basement? Cut down a tree? Dig a house out of the sand? Powered by Red Bull and granola bars, we developed capabilities to get volunteers where they were needed most. Using smart phones and iPads donated by Palantir, volunteers filed requests for assistance through Palantir Mobile, as they happened.</p>

				<p>We trained the Team Rubicon staff and volunteers to use Palantir Gotham, put them at the forefront, to maximize responsiveness. Plus, even before the storm hit, <a href="http://www.directrelief.org/">Direct Relief</a> partnered with us to do data analysis of the likely path of the storm and analyze real-time weather data after it hit, so they could pre-position supplies and medicine and best provide emergency medical supplies afterwards.</p>

				<h2>Operation Starting Gun<br />Moore, OK</h2>
				<p>Less than 24 hours after the tornado touched down, Team Rubicon and Palantir were on the go. The 205 mph winds that ripped through Moore on May 20th, 2013, killed 23 citizens, including nine children. More than 12,000 homes were destroyed. We set up HQ with Team Rubicon in a tent in a Home Depot parking lot and trained volunteers on Palantir Mobile devices. They completed 450 jobs, cleaning up damage and getting folks back on their feet at over 200 locations in 30 days.</p>

				<p>In the field, volunteers used Palantir Mobile to report conditions in real time back to headquarters, where they used Palantir Gotham to prioritize incoming work orders, create and revise operational plans and run metrics on completed jobs. Mobile's reporting feature captured information and images and transmitted them back to base. Users dynamically modified the "area of operations" according to the latest information from the field.</p>

				<p>As many as 25 teams simultaneously canvassed the city to produce the structural assessment reports essential to work flows: where this roof needs tarping, where that debris needs removal, who required the most, and most urgent, help. In that first week, Team Rubicon volunteers completed over 1,300 structural assessment reports, eventually surveying over 3,000.</p>

			<h2>Operation Seabird<br />Tacloban, Philippines</h2>
			<p>In November 2013 the most powerful hurricane ever recorded to make landfall, Typhoon Haiyan, claimed the lives of over 6,000 in that country alone. It displaced millions more. Within four days we had five engineers on the ground. We helped our partners Team Rubicon and Direct Relief coordinate their relief efforts by identifying key health facilities with pressing need.</p>

			<p>One glitch? In some of the most remote and damaged areas, there was no cell connectivity, which meant we couldn’t use Palantir Mobile. So, partnering with <a href="http://www.delorme.com/">Delorme</a>, we hacked together a purely satellite-based version of Palantir Mobile that allowed for two-way communications without cell reception. We called it MIMOSA (Mini-Mobile: Satellite).</p>

			<p>Direct Relief then purchased 130 InReach devices, which are equipped for GPS tracking anywhere in the world and can send and receive 160-character, SMS messages over satellite. Our development team built a plug-in to use the GPS data for real-time tracking of volunteers in the field—viewable in Raven, our powerful web-based geospatial analysis platform—and our Forward Deployed Engineers wrote a script to parse messages directly into Palantir to make analysis simple. We were up and running.</p>

				<h2>Finding Missing and Exploited Children</h2>
				<p>To assist law enforcement in finding and rescuing missing and exploited children, analysts at the <a href="http://www.missingkids.com/home">National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC)</a> must sort through mountains of data. With Palantir, work that took hours or days can be accomplished in seconds. They are able to create “human maps,” mapping findings geospatially and revealing links between people, places and groups.</p>

				<p>The platform helps our partner provide deeper insight and assistance to law enforcement, in cases old and new. By digitizing aging documents and importing them into Palantir, NCMEC analysts make them searchable and create structure that can lead to new insights for cases that are more than 20 years old. Using Palantir, analysts are also able to see if any current cases share any properties (phone number, address, Social Security Number, clues to location) which can help law enforcement locate missing or exploited children, or the offenders.</p>

				<p>In one California case, a 17-year-old girl was reported missing and suspected of being a victim of sex trafficking. Through various searches, a NCMEC analyst found multiple posts online that advertised the missing child for sex. Using information in the ads, the analyst tied them to other posts from the same pimp. Analysis eventually included over 50 advertisements, nine different females and a trail covering five states. And a Palantir link analysis graph allowed law enforcement to clearly see the large scope of the ring. This insight helped them link the pimp to a multitude of other crimes and, crucially, other girls he victimized.</p>

				<h2>Countering modern-day slavery</h2>
				<p>Our partner <a href="http://www.polarisproject.org/">Polaris Project</a> has assembled one of the most extensive databases on human trafficking in the US. This database of trafficking reports and trusted organizations, which can provide victim services or critical assistance in case of emergency, is key to an effective response to human trafficking.</p>

				<p>Previously, Polaris call specialists had to cross-reference online map resources and databases with Word documents that included more than 200 geographically-specific protocols in order to find the right nearby emergency response services, health services, shelter, or legal aid for victims of human trafficking.</p>

				<p>Now, with the click of a button in Palantir, they can access these key resources in seconds, respond immediately during crisis calls, and connect victims to the critical services they need.</p>

				<p>In addition, analysts look at data from over 100,000 hotline calls to help understand, and end, the scourge of modern- day slavery. With Palantir, they get the big picture: everything from mapping the routes of traveling sales crews or carnivals across the US to tracking sex trafficking at truck stops. Deciphering patterns by comparing hotline calls to trucking routes and analyzing links between cases, they are attempting to shine a light on specific networks with the goal of developing targeted interventions that strike at their roots.</p>

			Unraveling illicit networks, the raw data is dirty and incomplete on the best of days. And as good as algorithms and automation are, for complicated analysis you still need people. With Palantir, they can be exponentially more efficient and thorough when trying to identify trends and find the proverbial needle in the haystack of global commerce.

				<h2>Tracking nefarious shipments</h2>
				<p>After 10 months using Palantir, <a href="http://www.c4ads.org/">C4ADS</a> mapped the so-called "Odessa Network" of ships, organizations, and officials linked to the trafficking of arms into Syria from Ukraine. They discovered unknown or under-reported arms transfers; specific companies and individuals facilitating those transfers; and familial, financial and professional links to governments. Shortly after its release, one of the ships named in the report was pulled over by the Greek Coast Guard with 20,000 AK–47s and other ammo aboard, bound for Syria. Greek officials cited the Odessa Network research directly.</p>

				<p>Over the past year, C4ADS relied on Palantir’s ability to combine multiple, disparate open source data sets to reveal a complicated network of ships, transport companies, and key individuals involved in suspicious transactions. Their research into enablers of conflict has also led them to investigate illegal shipments of so-called “conflict charcoal” from Somalia, which is banned by the UN because charcoal profits are known to fund the terrorist group al-Shabaab.</p>

				<p>Palantir facilitated C4ADS' work mapping networks of maritime shell companies and international organizations who have been, knowingly or unknowingly, likely enablers of conflict in Somalia and Syria. With the Palantir Gotham platform, C4ADS uses data to understand conflict, security and development around the world. They are now working to map ivory seizures, investigating how the illicit trade of ivory funds terrorists and insurgents in Africa.</p>

				<h2>Veterans Data Project</h2>
				<p>Loads of veteran-related data, from the Veterans Administration (VA), Department of Defense (DoD), Census Bureau and others, is publicly available. But it’s unorganized, so hard to make sense of or re-purpose for other means. Researchers from our partner, the <a href="http://www.cnas.org/">Center for a New American Security (CNAS)</a>, worked for several months to gather this valuable data, then used our Metropolis platform to begin standardizing and analyzing the information.</p>

				<p>The first integration of VA data in the fall of 2013 produced visualizations of current VA facilities, the current veteran population, and official population projections through 2040 down to the US county level. Further data was integrated tracking VA expenditures by county. As the Veterans Data Project matures, CNAS researchers plan to include more data from the VA, DoD, and Census Bureau, as well as specialized data on suicide rates, homelessness, and unemployment. They’ll also use the analytic tools of Palantir Metropolis to develop models for the future veteran population in different social, political, and economic scenarios.</p>
