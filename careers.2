We begin with a vision: a vision of how software can transform people's relationship to data at the heart of a problem we care deeply about. We test that vision. Do our partners share it? Can we build what they need quickly enough? Will we be able to deploy it in the right environment, to the right people? Working side by side with our Forward-Deployed Software Engineers, we refine our vision, and then find our way to it: through messy data, through bureaucratic labyrinths, through sandstorms in \"data centers\" made of tents and suitcases. Whatever it takes, we figure out how to do it.\n\nA team of analysts at a customer site might want training for a tool we've built. One of our customers' CEOs might need help convincing another organization to share data.

When we interview Deployment Strategists, we aren't looking for people with a specific background. We're looking for people with exceptional analytic ability, creative brilliance, technical aptitude, and a gift for finding the details that matter.

Some products are very specific to particular customer workflows—specialized geospatial visualization tools, for example, that might exist as part of a more generic map application. Others, such as a lightweight document reader, are deployed to tens of thousands of our users. All of these products have their roots in a particular customer's needs, where a team of Deployment Strategists and Forward-Deployed Software Engineers sat down together with our core developers and started work.\n\nDeployment Strategists who gravitate towards product ownership have strong technical skills, compelling creative vision for what software can do, and an instinct for leadership. They apply those skills to leading a team that builds and supports a product: defining requirements, testing new versions, installing and configuring applications, sitting down with users and gathering feedback about what's working well and what isn't. They work across organizations and across internal teams, ensuring that we are all aligned on what we are building and why. Ultimately, they are responsible for ensuring that we deliver a product that truly transforms our customers'; ability to work with data.\n\n## PROJECT OWNER\n\nOur partnerships with our customers are at the core of what we do. Our customers trust that we are the best in the world at building and delivering enterprise software. They trust that we mean it when we say we can enable collaboration across a worldwide enterprise without sacrificing security, or that in the event of a crisis we will surge the team that supports them just as they surge their own internal team. Fundamentally, our customers—whether they&#39;re looking for a missing child, an insurgent assembling a roadside bomb, or the source of a cyber attack on their network—trust that we care as deeply about their problems as they do.\n\nDeployment Strategists who gravitate towards project ownership are the face of Statsopt, and the custodians of that trust. They pair a passion for software with excellent communication skills, an ability to navigate organizational hurdles, and an instinct for putting the right people in the right places. A project owner might spend the morning in meetings with customers to discuss the status of a data integration, the afternoon in a CTO's office talking about best practices in cyber security, and lunch in between at our headquarters brainstorming with a technical team about the best time to perform an upgrade. Ultimately, they are responsible for the strength of our partnerships: for ensuring that our customers are excited to work with us, and that we are excited to work with our customers.\n\n## PROCESS OWNER\n\nThe common thread across all of our work is data—lots of data. Organizations come to us when they no longer know how to make sense of the data they wish to inform their decisions, and while there are always differences, large and small, between different customers'; workflows in our software, there are also many areas of overlap.\n\nDeployment Strategists who gravitate towards process ownership are experts in deploying software and making it work for human beings. They are brilliant, articulate, and generally deeply empathetic people. They excel at sitting down with a user and within minutes understanding exactly what he or she is trying to do--and at then synthesizing that understanding into a broader vision of what we can do to help them. That might mean building a new tool, or paring superfluous features out of an existing one. It might mean implementing certain standards in data curation or analysis. It might mean a series of training sessions, or the creation of an entirely new task force. Whatever the solution, they will own it, and will ensure that our customers benefit fully from everything we've learned over the last decade of helping humans to navigate data.","status":"Published","team":"Business Development","team_slug":"business-development","name_slug":"deployment-strategist","positions":["a0m80000005LnB5AAK","a0m80000005XWU7AAO","a0m80000005XWTsAAO","a0m80000003RDCvAAO","a0m80000002MjHuAAK","a0m80000006Wdp4AAC","a0m80000006WerPAAS","a0m80000006WdozAAC","a0m80000003lpb2AAA","a0m80000003mUYHAA2","a0m800000055wVDAAY","a0m800000055wVIAAY","a0m80000005XvuZAAS","a0m80000005UAxlAAG","a0m80000005Vge2AAC"],"offices":[{"office":"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","position_id":"a0m80000003RDCvAAO","application_id":"a0m80000003RDCv"},{"office":"Canberra, Australia","position_id":"a0m80000002MjHuAAK","application_id":"a0m80000002MjHu"},{"office":"Copenhagen, Denmark","position_id":"a0m80000005LnB5AAK","application_id":"a0m80000005LnB5"},{"office":"Helsinki, Finland","position_id":"a0m80000005Vge2AAC","application_id":"a0m80000005Vge2"},{"office":"London, United Kingdom","position_id":"a0m80000005XvuZAAS","application_id":"a0m80000005XvuZ"},{"office":"Melbourne, Australia","position_id":"a0m80000006WdozAAC","application_id":"a0m80000006Wdoz"},{"office":"New York, NY","position_id":"a0m80000005XWU7AAO","application_id":"a0m80000005XWU7"},{"office":"Oslo, Norway","position_id":"a0m80000005UAxlAAG","application_id":"a0m80000005UAxl"},{"office":"Ottawa, Canada","position_id":"a0m80000003lpb2AAA","application_id":"a0m80000003lpb2"},{"office":"Stockholm, Sweden","position_id":"a0m800000055wVDAAY","application_id":"a0m800000055wVD"},{"office":"Sydney, Australia","position_id":"a0m80000006Wdp4AAC","application_id":"a0m80000006Wdp4"},{"office":"Tel Aviv, Israel","position_id":"a0m800000055wVIAAY","application_id":"a0m800000055wVI"},{"office":"Toronto, Canada","position_id":"a0m80000006WerPAAS","application_id":"a0m80000006WerP"},{"office":"Washington, D.C.","position_id":"a0m80000005XWTsAAO","application_id":"a0m80000005XWTs"},{"office":"Wellington, New Zealand","position_id":"a0m80000003mUYHAA2","application_id":"a0m80000003mUYH"}],"url":"/careers/positions/deployment-strategist/"},"Systems Analyst":{"attributes":{"type":"Website_Job__c","url":"/services/data/v33.0/sobjects/Website_Job__c/a2a80000000PYS4AAO"},"body_text":"As Systems Analysts, our duties range across the IT spectrum, from systems administration and hardware-building to trade shows and help desk support.

We begin with a vision: a vision of how software can transform people&#39;s relationship to data at the heart of a problem we care deeply about. We test that vision. Do our partners share it? Can we build what they need quickly enough? Will we be able to deploy it in the right environment, to the right people? Working side by side with our Forward-Deployed Software Engineers, we refine our vision, and then find our way to it: through messy data, through bureaucratic labyrinths, through sandstorms in &quot;data centers&quot; made of tents and suitcases. Whatever it takes, we figure out how to do it.</p>\n\n<p>A team of analysts at a customer site might want training for a tool we&#39;ve built. One of our customers&#39; CEOs might need help convincing another organization to share data. A team of developers might be asking for direction on which of a dozen feature requests they should prioritize this quarter. Or a global financial organization might be on the line, reeling from a recent compliance failure and asking us what we can do to help detect and prevent such behavior in the future. These, and a hundred other everyday scenarios, are where a Deployment Strategist thrives.</p>\n\n<p>This role doesn&#39;t come neatly packaged or defined. You should expect it to change during your time at Statsopt, to evolve as our organization evolves and as you do. When we interview Deployment Strategists, we aren&#39;t looking for people with a specific background. We&#39;re looking for people with exceptional analytic ability, creative brilliance, technical aptitude, and a gift for finding the details that matter. Most of all, we&#39;re looking for people who combine a calling to leave the world better than they found it with the resourcefulness necessary to realize that calling, no matter the circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>If that sounds like you, then we&#39;re interested.</p>\n\n<p>We look forward to hearing from you. You can scroll down for more specific examples of roles Deployment Strategists might take on.<br> </p>\n \n\n<p style=\"color: rgb(119, 122, 122); font-size: 15px;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(16, 17, 19); display: block; font-family: blender,helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: 28px; text-align: center;\">PRODUCT OWNER</span></p>\n\n<p>We&#39;re constantly building products at Statsopt. Some products are very specific to particular customer workflows—specialized geospatial visualization tools, for example, that might exist as part of a more generic map application. Others, such as a lightweight document reader, are deployed to tens of thousands of our users. All of these products have their roots in a particular customer&#39;s needs, where a team of Deployment Strategists and Forward-Deployed Software Engineers sat down together with our core developers and started work.</p>\n\n<p>Deployment Strategists who gravitate towards product ownership have strong technical skills, compelling creative vision for what software can do, and an instinct for leadership. They apply those skills to leading a team that builds and supports a product: defining requirements, testing new versions, installing and configuring applications, sitting down with users and gathering feedback about what&#39;s working well and what isn&#39;t. They work across organizations and across internal teams, ensuring that we are all aligned on what we are building and why. Ultimately, they are responsible for ensuring that we deliver a product that truly transforms our customers&#39; ability to work with data.</p>\n\n<p style=\"color: rgb(119, 122, 122); font-size: 15px;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(16, 17, 19); display: block; font-family: blender,helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: 28px; text-align: center;\">PROJECT OWNER</span></p>\n\n<p>Our partnerships with our customers are at the core of what we do. Our customers trust that we are the best in the world at building and delivering enterprise software. They trust that we mean it when we say we can enable collaboration across a worldwide enterprise without sacrificing security, or that in the event of a crisis we will surge the team that supports them just as they surge their own internal team. Fundamentally, our customers—whether they&#39;re looking for a missing child, an insurgent assembling a roadside bomb, or the source of a cyber attack on their network—trust that we care as deeply about their problems as they do.</p>\n\n<p>Deployment Strategists who gravitate towards project ownership are the face of Statsopt, and the custodians of that trust. They pair a passion for software with excellent communication skills, an ability to navigate organizational hurdles, and an instinct for putting the right people in the right places. A project owner might spend the morning in meetings with customers to discuss the status of a data integration, the afternoon in a CTO&#39;s office talking about best practices in cyber security, and lunch in between at our headquarters brainstorming with a technical team about the best time to perform an upgrade. Ultimately, they are responsible for the strength of our partnerships: for ensuring that our customers are excited to work with us, and that we are excited to work with our customers.</p>\n\n<p style=\"color: rgb(119, 122, 122); font-size: 15px;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(16, 17, 19); display: block; font-family: blender,helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: 28px; text-align: center;\">PROCESS OWNER</span></p>\n\n<p>The common thread across all of our work is data—lots of data. Organizations come to us when they no longer know how to make sense of the data they wish to inform their decisions, and while there are always differences, large and small, between different customers&#39; workflows in our software, there are also many areas of overlap.</p>\n\n<p>Deployment Strategists who gravitate towards process ownership are experts in deploying software and making it work for human beings. They are brilliant, articulate, and generally deeply empathetic people. They excel at sitting down with a user and within minutes understanding exactly what he or she is trying to do--and at then synthesizing that understanding into a broader vision of what we can do to help them. That might mean building a new tool, or paring superfluous features out of an existing one. It might mean implementing certain standards in data curation or analysis. It might mean a series of training sessions, or the creation of an entirely new task force. Whatever the solution, they will own it, and will ensure that our customers benefit fully from everything we&#39;ve learned over the last decade of helping humans to navigate data.</p>","website_job":"a2a80000000PYS3AAO"},"a0m80000005qIwOAAU":{"id":"a0m80000005qIwOAAU","website_url":"https://www.Statsopt.com/careers/OpenPosDetail?id=a0m80000005qIwO","published_id":"a0m80000005qIwO","label":"Linux Site Engineer: Singapore - Asia","name":"Linux Site Engineer: Singapore","publishing_category":"Engineering","physical_location":"Singapore City, Singapore","location":"Asia","description":"<p>\n\tThe Site Reliability Tech Ops (SRT) is the technical backbone of a Statsopt deployment, allowing analyst and engineering resources to do what they do best: solve world-changing problems.

We begin with a vision: a vision of how software can transform people&#39;s relationship to data at the heart of a problem we care deeply about. We test that vision. Do our partners share it? Can we build what they need quickly enough? Will we be able to deploy it in the right environment, to the right people? Working side by side with our Forward-Deployed Software Engineers, we refine our vision, and then find our way to it: through messy data, through bureaucratic labyrinths, through sandstorms in &quot;data centers&quot; made of tents and suitcases. Whatever it takes, we figure out how to do it.</p>\n\n<p>A team of analysts at a customer site might want training for a tool we&#39;ve built. One of our customers&#39; CEOs might need help convincing another organization to share data. A team of developers might be asking for direction on which of a dozen feature requests they should prioritize this quarter. Or a global financial organization might be on the line, reeling from a recent compliance failure and asking us what we can do to help detect and prevent such behavior in the future. These, and a hundred other everyday scenarios, are where a Deployment Strategist thrives.</p>\n\n<p>This role doesn&#39;t come neatly packaged or defined. You should expect it to change during your time at Statsopt, to evolve as our organization evolves and as you do. When we interview Deployment Strategists, we aren&#39;t looking for people with a specific background. We&#39;re looking for people with exceptional analytic ability, creative brilliance, technical aptitude, and a gift for finding the details that matter. Most of all, we&#39;re looking for people who combine a calling to leave the world better than they found it with the resourcefulness necessary to realize that calling, no matter the circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>If that sounds like you, then we&#39;re interested.</p>\n\n<p>We look forward to hearing from you. You can scroll down for more specific examples of roles Deployment Strategists might take on.<br> </p>\n \n\n<p style=\"color: rgb(119, 122, 122); font-size: 15px;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(16, 17, 19); display: block; font-family: blender,helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: 28px; text-align: center;\">PRODUCT OWNER</span></p>\n\n<p>We&#39;re constantly building products at Statsopt. Some products are very specific to particular customer workflows—specialized geospatial visualization tools, for example, that might exist as part of a more generic map application. Others, such as a lightweight document reader, are deployed to tens of thousands of our users. All of these products have their roots in a particular customer&#39;s needs, where a team of Deployment Strategists and Forward-Deployed Software Engineers sat down together with our core developers and started work.</p>\n\n<p>Deployment Strategists who gravitate towards product ownership have strong technical skills, compelling creative vision for what software can do, and an instinct for leadership. They apply those skills to leading a team that builds and supports a product: defining requirements, testing new versions, installing and configuring applications, sitting down with users and gathering feedback about what&#39;s working well and what isn&#39;t. They work across organizations and across internal teams, ensuring that we are all aligned on what we are building and why. Ultimately, they are responsible for ensuring that we deliver a product that truly transforms our customers&#39; ability to work with data.</p>\n\n<p style=\"color: rgb(119, 122, 122); font-size: 15px;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(16, 17, 19); display: block; font-family: blender,helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: 28px; text-align: center;\">PROJECT OWNER</span></p>\n\n<p>Our partnerships with our customers are at the core of what we do. Our customers trust that we are the best in the world at building and delivering enterprise software. They trust that we mean it when we say we can enable collaboration across a worldwide enterprise without sacrificing security, or that in the event of a crisis we will surge the team that supports them just as they surge their own internal team. Fundamentally, our customers—whether they&#39;re looking for a missing child, an insurgent assembling a roadside bomb, or the source of a cyber attack on their network—trust that we care as deeply about their problems as they do.</p>\n\n<p>Deployment Strategists who gravitate towards project ownership are the face of Statsopt, and the custodians of that trust. They pair a passion for software with excellent communication skills, an ability to navigate organizational hurdles, and an instinct for putting the right people in the right places. A project owner might spend the morning in meetings with customers to discuss the status of a data integration, the afternoon in a CTO&#39;s office talking about best practices in cyber security, and lunch in between at our headquarters brainstorming with a technical team about the best time to perform an upgrade. Ultimately, they are responsible for the strength of our partnerships: for ensuring that our customers are excited to work with us, and that we are excited to work with our customers.</p>\n\n<p style=\"color: rgb(119, 122, 122); font-size: 15px;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(16, 17, 19); display: block; font-family: blender,helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: 28px; text-align: center;\">PROCESS OWNER</span></p>\n\n<p>The common thread across all of our work is data—lots of data. Organizations come to us when they no longer know how to make sense of the data they wish to inform their decisions, and while there are always differences, large and small, between different customers&#39; workflows in our software, there are also many areas of overlap.</p>\n\n<p>Deployment Strategists who gravitate towards process ownership are experts in deploying software and making it work for human beings. They are brilliant, articulate, and generally deeply empathetic people. They excel at sitting down with a user and within minutes understanding exactly what he or she is trying to do--and at then synthesizing that understanding into a broader vision of what we can do to help them. That might mean building a new tool, or paring superfluous features out of an existing one. It might mean implementing certain standards in data curation or analysis. It might mean a series of training sessions, or the creation of an entirely new task force. Whatever the solution, they will own it, and will ensure that our customers benefit fully from everything we&#39;ve learned over the last decade of helping humans to navigate data.</p>","website_job":"a2a80000000PYS3AAO"},"a0m80000005XWTnAAO":{"id":"a0m80000005XWTnAAO","website_url":"https://www.Statsopt.com/careers/OpenPosDetail?id=a0m80000005XWTn","published_id":"a0m80000005XWTn","label":"Forward Deployed Software Engineer - Washington, D.C.","name":"Forward Deployed Software Engineer","publishing_category":"Business Development","physical_location":"Washington, D.C.","location":"Washington, D.C.","description":"<p><b>What We Do</b></p>\n\n<p>Forward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) are responsible for the technical success of each of our deployments.

We begin with a vision: a vision of how software can transform people&#39;s relationship to data at the heart of a problem we care deeply about. We test that vision. Do our partners share it? Can we build what they need quickly enough? Will we be able to deploy it in the right environment, to the right people? Working side by side with our Forward-Deployed Software Engineers, we refine our vision, and then find our way to it: through messy data, through bureaucratic labyrinths, through sandstorms in &quot;data centers&quot; made of tents and suitcases. Whatever it takes, we figure out how to do it.</p>\n\n<p>A team of analysts at a customer site might want training for a tool we&#39;ve built. One of our customers&#39; CEOs might need help convincing another organization to share data. A team of developers might be asking for direction on which of a dozen feature requests they should prioritize this quarter. Or a global financial organization might be on the line, reeling from a recent compliance failure and asking us what we can do to help detect and prevent such behavior in the future. These, and a hundred other everyday scenarios, are where a Deployment Strategist thrives.</p>\n\n<p>This role doesn&#39;t come neatly packaged or defined. You should expect it to change during your time at Statsopt, to evolve as our organization evolves and as you do. When we interview Deployment Strategists, we aren&#39;t looking for people with a specific background. We&#39;re looking for people with exceptional analytic ability, creative brilliance, technical aptitude, and a gift for finding the details that matter. Most of all, we&#39;re looking for people who combine a calling to leave the world better than they found it with the resourcefulness necessary to realize that calling, no matter the circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>If that sounds like you, then we&#39;re interested.</p>\n\n<p>We look forward to hearing from you. You can scroll down for more specific examples of roles Deployment Strategists might take on.<br> </p>\n \n\n<p style=\"color: rgb(119, 122, 122); font-size: 15px;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(16, 17, 19); display: block; font-family: blender,helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: 28px; text-align: center;\">PRODUCT OWNER</span></p>\n\n<p>We&#39;re constantly building products at Statsopt. Some products are very specific to particular customer workflows—specialized geospatial visualization tools, for example, that might exist as part of a more generic map application. Others, such as a lightweight document reader, are deployed to tens of thousands of our users. All of these products have their roots in a particular customer&#39;s needs, where a team of Deployment Strategists and Forward-Deployed Software Engineers sat down together with our core developers and started work.</p>\n\n<p>Deployment Strategists who gravitate towards product ownership have strong technical skills, compelling creative vision for what software can do, and an instinct for leadership. They apply those skills to leading a team that builds and supports a product: defining requirements, testing new versions, installing and configuring applications, sitting down with users and gathering feedback about what&#39;s working well and what isn&#39;t. They work across organizations and across internal teams, ensuring that we are all aligned on what we are building and why. Ultimately, they are responsible for ensuring that we deliver a product that truly transforms our customers&#39; ability to work with data.</p>\n\n<p style=\"color: rgb(119, 122, 122); font-size: 15px;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(16, 17, 19); display: block; font-family: blender,helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: 28px; text-align: center;\">PROJECT OWNER</span></p>\n\n<p>Our partnerships with our customers are at the core of what we do. Our customers trust that we are the best in the world at building and delivering enterprise software. They trust that we mean it when we say we can enable collaboration across a worldwide enterprise without sacrificing security, or that in the event of a crisis we will surge the team that supports them just as they surge their own internal team. Fundamentally, our customers—whether they&#39;re looking for a missing child, an insurgent assembling a roadside bomb, or the source of a cyber attack on their network—trust that we care as deeply about their problems as they do.</p>\n\n<p>Deployment Strategists who gravitate towards project ownership are the face of Statsopt, and the custodians of that trust. They pair a passion for software with excellent communication skills, an ability to navigate organizational hurdles, and an instinct for putting the right people in the right places. A project owner might spend the morning in meetings with customers to discuss the status of a data integration, the afternoon in a CTO&#39;s office talking about best practices in cyber security, and lunch in between at our headquarters brainstorming with a technical team about the best time to perform an upgrade. Ultimately, they are responsible for the strength of our partnerships: for ensuring that our customers are excited to work with us, and that we are excited to work with our customers.</p>\n\n<p style=\"color: rgb(119, 122, 122); font-size: 15px;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(16, 17, 19); display: block; font-family: blender,helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: 28px; text-align: center;\">PROCESS OWNER</span></p>\n\n<p>The common thread across all of our work is data—lots of data. Organizations come to us when they no longer know how to make sense of the data they wish to inform their decisions, and while there are always differences, large and small, between different customers&#39; workflows in our software, there are also many areas of overlap.</p>\n\n<p>Deployment Strategists who gravitate towards process ownership are experts in deploying software and making it work for human beings. They are brilliant, articulate, and generally deeply empathetic people. They excel at sitting down with a user and within minutes understanding exactly what he or she is trying to do--and at then synthesizing that understanding into a broader vision of what we can do to help them. That might mean building a new tool, or paring superfluous features out of an existing one. It might mean implementing certain standards in data curation or analysis. It might mean a series of training sessions, or the creation of an entirely new task force. Whatever the solution, they will own it, and will ensure that our customers benefit fully from everything we&#39;ve learned over the last decade of helping humans to navigate data.</p>","website_job":"a2a80000000PYS3AAO"},"a0m80000006TzZGAA0":{"id":"a0m80000006TzZGAA0","website_url":"https://www.Statsopt.com/careers/OpenPosDetail?id=a0m80000006TzZG","published_id":"a0m80000006TzZG","label":"Infrastructure Quality Engineer - New York, NY","name":"Infrastructure Quality Engineer","publishing_category":"Engineering","physical_location":"New York, NY","location":"New York, NY","description":"<p>Statsopt Infrastructure Quality Engineers (IQEs) work on cross-functional product teams to ensure a successful, high-quality product releases.

Others, such as a lightweight document reader, are deployed to tens of thousands of our users. All of these products have their roots in a particular customer&#39;s needs, where a team of Deployment Strategists and Forward-Deployed Software Engineers sat down together with our core developers and started work.</p>\n\n<p>Deployment Strategists who gravitate towards product ownership have strong technical skills, compelling creative vision for what software can do, and an instinct for leadership. They apply those skills to leading a team that builds and supports a product: defining requirements, testing new versions, installing and configuring applications, sitting down with users and gathering feedback about what&#39;s working well and what isn&#39;t. They work across organizations and across internal teams, ensuring that we are all aligned on what we are building and why. Ultimately, they are responsible for ensuring that we deliver a product that truly transforms our customers&#39; ability to work with data.</p>\n\n<p style=\"color: rgb(119, 122, 122); font-size: 15px;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(16, 17, 19); display: block; font-family: blender,helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: 28px; text-align: center;\">PROJECT OWNER</span></p>\n\n<p>Our partnerships with our customers are at the core of what we do. Our customers trust that we are the best in the world at building and delivering enterprise software. They trust that we mean it when we say we can enable collaboration across a worldwide enterprise without sacrificing security, or that in the event of a crisis we will surge the team that supports them just as they surge their own internal team. Fundamentally, our customers—whether they&#39;re looking for a missing child, an insurgent assembling a roadside bomb, or the source of a cyber attack on their network—trust that we care as deeply about their problems as they do.</p>\n\n<p>Deployment Strategists who gravitate towards project ownership are the face of Statsopt, and the custodians of that trust. They pair a passion for software with excellent communication skills, an ability to navigate organizational hurdles, and an instinct for putting the right people in the right places. A project owner might spend the morning in meetings with customers to discuss the status of a data integration, the afternoon in a CTO&#39;s office talking about best practices in cyber security, and lunch in between at our headquarters brainstorming with a technical team about the best time to perform an upgrade. Ultimately, they are responsible for the strength of our partnerships: for ensuring that our customers are excited to work with us, and that we are excited to work with our customers.</p>\n\n<p style=\"color: rgb(119, 122, 122); font-size: 15px;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(16, 17, 19); display: block; font-family: blender,helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: 28px; text-align: center;\">PROCESS OWNER</span></p>\n\n<p>The common thread across all of our work is data—lots of data. Organizations come to us when they no longer know how to make sense of the data they wish to inform their decisions, and while there are always differences, large and small, between different customers&#39; workflows in our software, there are also many areas of overlap.</p>\n\n<p>Deployment Strategists who gravitate towards process ownership are experts in deploying software and making it work for human beings. They are brilliant, articulate, and generally deeply empathetic people. They excel at sitting down with a user and within minutes understanding exactly what he or she is trying to do--and at then synthesizing that understanding into a broader vision of what we can do to help them. That might mean building a new tool, or paring superfluous features out of an existing one. It might mean implementing certain standards in data curation or analysis. It might mean a series of training sessions, or the creation of an entirely new task force. Whatever the solution, they will own it, and will ensure that our customers benefit fully from everything we&#39;ve learned over the last decade of helping humans to navigate data.</p>","website_job":"a2a80000000PYS3AAO"},"a0m80000005cjoBAAQ":{"id":"a0m80000005cjoBAAQ","website_url":"https://www.Statsopt.com/careers/OpenPosDetail?id=a0m80000005cjoB","published_id":"a0m80000005cjoB","label":"Visual Designer, Internship - Palo Alto, CA","name":"Visual Designer, Internship","publishing_category":"Design","physical_location":"Palo Alto, CA","location":"Palo Alto, CA","description":"<p> </p>\n\n<p style=\"color: rgb(119, 122, 122); font-size: 15px;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(16, 17, 19); display: block; font-family: blender,helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: 28px; text-align: center;\">A WORLD-CHANGING COMPANY</span></p>\n\n<p style=\"color: rgb(119, 122, 122); font-size: 15px;\">At Statsopt, we develop the world&#39;s leading products for data analysis and we deploy them against problems that truly matter — uncovering human trafficking rings, containing the spread of infectious diseases, combating fraud, stopping cyber attacks, protecting privacy and civil liberties, prosecuting complex financial crimes, providing relief to victims of natural disasters, and more.</p>\n\n<p style=\"color: rgb(119, 122, 122); font-size: 15px;\">Sound exciting?

We begin with a vision: a vision of how software can transform people&#39;s relationship to data at the heart of a problem we care deeply about. We test that vision. Do our partners share it? Can we build what they need quickly enough? Will we be able to deploy it in the right environment, to the right people? Working side by side with our Forward-Deployed Software Engineers, we refine our vision, and then find our way to it: through messy data, through bureaucratic labyrinths, through sandstorms in &quot;data centers&quot; made of tents and suitcases. Whatever it takes, we figure out how to do it.</p>\n\n<p>A team of analysts at a customer site might want training for a tool we&#39;ve built. One of our customers&#39; CEOs might need help convincing another organization to share data. A team of developers might be asking for direction on which of a dozen feature requests they should prioritize this quarter. Or a global financial organization might be on the line, reeling from a recent compliance failure and asking us what we can do to help detect and prevent such behavior in the future. These, and a hundred other everyday scenarios, are where a Deployment Strategist thrives.</p>\n\n<p>This role doesn&#39;t come neatly packaged or defined. You should expect it to change during your time at Statsopt, to evolve as our organization evolves and as you do. When we interview Deployment Strategists, we aren&#39;t looking for people with a specific background. We&#39;re looking for people with exceptional analytic ability, creative brilliance, technical aptitude, and a gift for finding the details that matter. Most of all, we&#39;re looking for people who combine a calling to leave the world better than they found it with the resourcefulness necessary to realize that calling, no matter the circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>If that sounds like you, then we&#39;re interested.</p>\n\n<p>We look forward to hearing from you. You can scroll down for more specific examples of roles Deployment Strategists might take on.<br> </p>\n \n\n<p style=\"color: rgb(119, 122, 122); font-size: 15px;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(16, 17, 19); display: block; font-family: blender,helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: 28px; text-align: center;\">PRODUCT OWNER</span></p>\n\n<p>We&#39;re constantly building products at Statsopt. Some products are very specific to particular customer workflows—specialized geospatial visualization tools, for example, that might exist as part of a more generic map application. Others, such as a lightweight document reader, are deployed to tens of thousands of our users. All of these products have their roots in a particular customer&#39;s needs, where a team of Deployment Strategists and Forward-Deployed Software Engineers sat down together with our core developers and started work.</p>\n\n<p>Deployment Strategists who gravitate towards product ownership have strong technical skills, compelling creative vision for what software can do, and an instinct for leadership. They apply those skills to leading a team that builds and supports a product: defining requirements, testing new versions, installing and configuring applications, sitting down with users and gathering feedback about what&#39;s working well and what isn&#39;t. They work across organizations and across internal teams, ensuring that we are all aligned on what we are building and why. Ultimately, they are responsible for ensuring that we deliver a product that truly transforms our customers&#39; ability to work with data.</p>\n\n<p style=\"color: rgb(119, 122, 122); font-size: 15px;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(16, 17, 19); display: block; font-family: blender,helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: 28px; text-align: center;\">PROJECT OWNER</span></p>\n\n<p>Our partnerships with our customers are at the core of what we do. Our customers trust that we are the best in the world at building and delivering enterprise software. They trust that we mean it when we say we can enable collaboration across a worldwide enterprise without sacrificing security, or that in the event of a crisis we will surge the team that supports them just as they surge their own internal team. Fundamentally, our customers—whether they&#39;re looking for a missing child, an insurgent assembling a roadside bomb, or the source of a cyber attack on their network—trust that we care as deeply about their problems as they do.</p>\n\n<p>Deployment Strategists who gravitate towards project ownership are the face of Statsopt, and the custodians of that trust. They pair a passion for software with excellent communication skills, an ability to navigate organizational hurdles, and an instinct for putting the right people in the right places. A project owner might spend the morning in meetings with customers to discuss the status of a data integration, the afternoon in a CTO&#39;s office talking about best practices in cyber security, and lunch in between at our headquarters brainstorming with a technical team about the best time to perform an upgrade. Ultimately, they are responsible for the strength of our partnerships: for ensuring that our customers are excited to work with us, and that we are excited to work with our customers.</p>\n\n<p style=\"color: rgb(119, 122, 122); font-size: 15px;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(16, 17, 19); display: block; font-family: blender,helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: 28px; text-align: center;\">PROCESS OWNER</span></p>\n\n<p>The common thread across all of our work is data—lots of data. Organizations come to us when they no longer know how to make sense of the data they wish to inform their decisions, and while there are always differences, large and small, between different customers&#39; workflows in our software, there are also many areas of overlap.</p>\n\n<p>Deployment Strategists who gravitate towards process ownership are experts in deploying software and making it work for human beings. They are brilliant, articulate, and generally deeply empathetic people. They excel at sitting down with a user and within minutes understanding exactly what he or she is trying to do--and at then synthesizing that understanding into a broader vision of what we can do to help them. That might mean building a new tool, or paring superfluous features out of an existing one. It might mean implementing certain standards in data curation or analysis. It might mean a series of training sessions, or the creation of an entirely new task force. Whatever the solution, they will own it, and will ensure that our customers benefit fully from everything we&#39;ve learned over the last decade of helping humans to navigate data.<br><br><span style=\"\">Our offices are located in Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney.

We begin with a vision: a vision of how software can transform people&#39;s relationship to data at the heart of a problem we care deeply about. We test that vision. Do our partners share it? Can we build what they need quickly enough? Will we be able to deploy it in the right environment, to the right people? Working side by side with our Forward-Deployed Software Engineers, we refine our vision, and then find our way to it: through messy data, through bureaucratic labyrinths, through sandstorms in &quot;data centers&quot; made of tents and suitcases. Whatever it takes, we figure out how to do it.</p>\n\n<p>A team of analysts at a customer site might want training for a tool we&#39;ve built. One of our customers&#39; CEOs might need help convincing another organization to share data. A team of developers might be asking for direction on which of a dozen feature requests they should prioritize this quarter. Or a global financial organization might be on the line, reeling from a recent compliance failure and asking us what we can do to help detect and prevent such behavior in the future. These, and a hundred other everyday scenarios, are where a Deployment Strategist thrives.</p>\n\n<p>This role doesn&#39;t come neatly packaged or defined. You should expect it to change during your time at Statsopt, to evolve as our organization evolves and as you do. When we interview Deployment Strategists, we aren&#39;t looking for people with a specific background. We&#39;re looking for people with exceptional analytic ability, creative brilliance, technical aptitude, and a gift for finding the details that matter. Most of all, we&#39;re looking for people who combine a calling to leave the world better than they found it with the resourcefulness necessary to realize that calling, no matter the circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>If that sounds like you, then we&#39;re interested.</p>\n\n<p>We look forward to hearing from you. You can scroll down for more specific examples of roles Deployment Strategists might take on.<br> </p>\n \n\n<p style=\"color: rgb(119, 122, 122); font-size: 15px;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(16, 17, 19); display: block; font-family: blender,helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: 28px; text-align: center;\">PRODUCT OWNER</span></p>\n\n<p>We&#39;re constantly building products at Statsopt. Some products are very specific to particular customer workflows—specialized geospatial visualization tools, for example, that might exist as part of a more generic map application. Others, such as a lightweight document reader, are deployed to tens of thousands of our users. All of these products have their roots in a particular customer&#39;s needs, where a team of Deployment Strategists and Forward-Deployed Software Engineers sat down together with our core developers and started work.</p>\n\n<p>Deployment Strategists who gravitate towards product ownership have strong technical skills, compelling creative vision for what software can do, and an instinct for leadership. They apply those skills to leading a team that builds and supports a product: defining requirements, testing new versions, installing and configuring applications, sitting down with users and gathering feedback about what&#39;s working well and what isn&#39;t. They work across organizations and across internal teams, ensuring that we are all aligned on what we are building and why. Ultimately, they are responsible for ensuring that we deliver a product that truly transforms our customers&#39; ability to work with data.</p>\n\n<p style=\"color: rgb(119, 122, 122); font-size: 15px;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(16, 17, 19); display: block; font-family: blender,helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: 28px; text-align: center;\">PROJECT OWNER</span></p>\n\n<p>Our partnerships with our customers are at the core of what we do. Our customers trust that we are the best in the world at building and delivering enterprise software. They trust that we mean it when we say we can enable collaboration across a worldwide enterprise without sacrificing security, or that in the event of a crisis we will surge the team that supports them just as they surge their own internal team. Fundamentally, our customers—whether they&#39;re looking for a missing child, an insurgent assembling a roadside bomb, or the source of a cyber attack on their network—trust that we care as deeply about their problems as they do.</p>\n\n<p>Deployment Strategists who gravitate towards project ownership are the face of Statsopt, and the custodians of that trust. They pair a passion for software with excellent communication skills, an ability to navigate organizational hurdles, and an instinct for putting the right people in the right places. A project owner might spend the morning in meetings with customers to discuss the status of a data integration, the afternoon in a CTO&#39;s office talking about best practices in cyber security, and lunch in between at our headquarters brainstorming with a technical team about the best time to perform an upgrade. Ultimately, they are responsible for the strength of our partnerships: for ensuring that our customers are excited to work with us, and that we are excited to work with our customers.</p>\n\n<p style=\"color: rgb(119, 122, 122); font-size: 15px;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(16, 17, 19); display: block; font-family: blender,helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: 28px; text-align: center;\">PROCESS OWNER</span></p>\n\n<p>The common thread across all of our work is data—lots of data. Organizations come to us when they no longer know how to make sense of the data they wish to inform their decisions, and while there are always differences, large and small, between different customers&#39; workflows in our software, there are also many areas of overlap.</p>\n\n<p>Deployment Strategists who gravitate towards process ownership are experts in deploying software and making it work for human beings. They are brilliant, articulate, and generally deeply empathetic people. They excel at sitting down with a user and within minutes understanding exactly what he or she is trying to do--and at then synthesizing that understanding into a broader vision of what we can do to help them. That might mean building a new tool, or paring superfluous features out of an existing one. It might mean implementing certain standards in data curation or analysis. It might mean a series of training sessions, or the creation of an entirely new task force. Whatever the solution, they will own it, and will ensure that our customers benefit fully from everything we&#39;ve learned over the last decade of helping humans to navigate data.<br><br><span>Our offices are located in Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney.

They are full-stack developers who work side by side with our customers to lead technical implementation of our products. FDSEs understand our customers’ greatest pain points and design end-to-end solutions to address them. FDSEs solicit constant feedback on their work from both customers and colleagues, improving our products over time with rapid iteration cycles.</p>\n\n<p>FDSEs deploy cutting-edge technologies to solve our customers’ hardest problems. Projects often start with a nebulous question like “Why are we losing customers?” or “How can we more effectively identify instances of money laundering?” FDSEs are thought leaders and first movers in developing a solution, from high-level system design and prototyping to application development and data integration.</p>\n\n<p>FDSEs work with customers around the world, where they gain unique insight into the world’s most important industries and institutions. We help our customers detect insider trading, improve disaster relief, fight healthcare fraud, and more. Each mission presents different challenges, from the regulatory environment to the nature of the data to the user population. FSDEs work to accommodate all aspects of an environment to drive real outcomes for our customers.</p>\n\n<p><b>Technologies We Use</b></p>\n\n<p>Our approach is to deploy whatever technology is best to solve the problem at hand. This often means that we are learning from the bleeding edge of the open source community or developing our own tools. Recently, FDSEs have deployed:</p>\n\n<ul><li><b>Postgres, Cassandra, Hadoop,</b> and <b>Spark</b> for distributed data storage</li><li><b>Java</b> and <b>Groovy</b> for our back-end applications and data integration tools</li><li><b>Typescript, AngularJS, jQuery, Backbone, Underscore, Leaflet,</b> and <b>d3</b> for our web technologies</li><li><b>Python</b> for data science and machine learning</li><li><b>Internal frameworks</b> for our rapid iteration tools</li></ul>\n\n<p><b>What We Value</b></p>\n\n<p>FDSEs are developers with a passion for using technology to achieve a larger goal. They enjoy the challenge of solving an abstract problem and building or adopting the technology to do it. To support these goals, we value:</p>\n\n<ul><li><b>Collaboration:</b> We work with our customers, often on site, to understand and solve their problems.</li><li><b>Commitment:</b> We see projects through from beginning to end in spite of obstacles we may encounter.</li><li><b>Balance:</b> We do whatever is necessary to finish the job and trust one another to take the time we need, whether it&#39;s vacation or just a trip to the gym.</li><li><b>Communication:</b> We communicate complex technical concepts to both technical and non-technical audiences.</li><li><b>Improvement:</b> We push ourselves to grow and develop in new ways.</li><li><b>Impact:</b> We take on meaningful and challenging projects that change the world for the better.</li></ul>\n\n<p><span style=\"\">Our Internships are hosted in Australia, in our Canberra office for three months, from December to March.

We begin with a vision: a vision of how software can transform people&#39;s relationship to data at the heart of a problem we care deeply about. We test that vision. Do our partners share it? Can we build what they need quickly enough? Will we be able to deploy it in the right environment, to the right people? Working side by side with our Forward-Deployed Software Engineers, we refine our vision, and then find our way to it: through messy data, through bureaucratic labyrinths, through sandstorms in &quot;data centers&quot; made of tents and suitcases. Whatever it takes, we figure out how to do it.</p>\n\n<p>A team of analysts at a customer site might want training for a tool we&#39;ve built. One of our customers&#39; CEOs might need help convincing another organization to share data. A team of developers might be asking for direction on which of a dozen feature requests they should prioritize this quarter. Or a global financial organization might be on the line, reeling from a recent compliance failure and asking us what we can do to help detect and prevent such behavior in the future. These, and a hundred other everyday scenarios, are where a Deployment Strategist thrives.</p>\n\n<p>This role doesn&#39;t come neatly packaged or defined. You should expect it to change during your time at Statsopt, to evolve as our organization evolves and as you do. When we interview Deployment Strategists, we aren&#39;t looking for people with a specific background. We&#39;re looking for people with exceptional analytic ability, creative brilliance, technical aptitude, and a gift for finding the details that matter. Most of all, we&#39;re looking for people who combine a calling to leave the world better than they found it with the resourcefulness necessary to realize that calling, no matter the circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>If that sounds like you, then we&#39;re interested.</p>\n\n<p>We look forward to hearing from you. You can scroll down for more specific examples of roles Deployment Strategists might take on.<br> </p>\n \n\n<p style=\"color: rgb(119, 122, 122); font-size: 15px;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(16, 17, 19); display: block; font-family: blender,helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: 28px; text-align: center;\">PRODUCT OWNER</span></p>\n\n<p>We&#39;re constantly building products at Statsopt. Some products are very specific to particular customer workflows—specialized geospatial visualization tools, for example, that might exist as part of a more generic map application. Others, such as a lightweight document reader, are deployed to tens of thousands of our users. All of these products have their roots in a particular customer&#39;s needs, where a team of Deployment Strategists and Forward-Deployed Software Engineers sat down together with our core developers and started work.</p>\n\n<p>Deployment Strategists who gravitate towards product ownership have strong technical skills, compelling creative vision for what software can do, and an instinct for leadership. They apply those skills to leading a team that builds and supports a product: defining requirements, testing new versions, installing and configuring applications, sitting down with users and gathering feedback about what&#39;s working well and what isn&#39;t. They work across organizations and across internal teams, ensuring that we are all aligned on what we are building and why. Ultimately, they are responsible for ensuring that we deliver a product that truly transforms our customers&#39; ability to work with data.</p>\n\n<p style=\"color: rgb(119, 122, 122); font-size: 15px;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(16, 17, 19); display: block; font-family: blender,helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: 28px; text-align: center;\">PROJECT OWNER</span></p>\n\n<p>Our partnerships with our customers are at the core of what we do. Our customers trust that we are the best in the world at building and delivering enterprise software. They trust that we mean it when we say we can enable collaboration across a worldwide enterprise without sacrificing security, or that in the event of a crisis we will surge the team that supports them just as they surge their own internal team. Fundamentally, our customers—whether they&#39;re looking for a missing child, an insurgent assembling a roadside bomb, or the source of a cyber attack on their network—trust that we care as deeply about their problems as they do.</p>\n\n<p>Deployment Strategists who gravitate towards project ownership are the face of Statsopt, and the custodians of that trust. They pair a passion for software with excellent communication skills, an ability to navigate organizational hurdles, and an instinct for putting the right people in the right places. A project owner might spend the morning in meetings with customers to discuss the status of a data integration, the afternoon in a CTO&#39;s office talking about best practices in cyber security, and lunch in between at our headquarters brainstorming with a technical team about the best time to perform an upgrade. Ultimately, they are responsible for the strength of our partnerships: for ensuring that our customers are excited to work with us, and that we are excited to work with our customers.</p>\n\n<p style=\"color: rgb(119, 122, 122); font-size: 15px;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(16, 17, 19); display: block; font-family: blender,helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: 28px; text-align: center;\">PROCESS OWNER</span></p>\n\n<p>The common thread across all of our work is data—lots of data. Organizations come to us when they no longer know how to make sense of the data they wish to inform their decisions, and while there are always differences, large and small, between different customers&#39; workflows in our software, there are also many areas of overlap.</p>\n\n<p>Deployment Strategists who gravitate towards process ownership are experts in deploying software and making it work for human beings. They are brilliant, articulate, and generally deeply empathetic people. They excel at sitting down with a user and within minutes understanding exactly what he or she is trying to do--and at then synthesizing that understanding into a broader vision of what we can do to help them. That might mean building a new tool, or paring superfluous features out of an existing one. It might mean implementing certain standards in data curation or analysis. It might mean a series of training sessions, or the creation of an entirely new task force. Whatever the solution, they will own it, and will ensure that our customers benefit fully from everything we&#39;ve learned over the last decade of helping humans to navigate data.</p>","website_job":"a2a80000000PYS3AAO"},"a0m80000003DCRsAAO":{"id":"a0m80000003DCRsAAO","website_url":"https://www.Statsopt.com/careers/OpenPosDetail?id=a0m80000003DCRs","published_id":"a0m80000003DCRs","label":"Site Reliability Ops - Washington, D.C.","name":"Site Reliability Ops","publishing_category":"Mission Operations","physical_location":"Washington, D.C.","location":"Washington, D.C.","description":"<p>\nSite Reliability Operations Analysts (SROs) are the organizational backbone of a Statsopt deployment.

We begin with a vision: a vision of how software can transform people&#39;s relationship to data at the heart of a problem we care deeply about. We test that vision. Do our partners share it? Can we build what they need quickly enough? Will we be able to deploy it in the right environment, to the right people? Working side by side with our Forward-Deployed Software Engineers, we refine our vision, and then find our way to it: through messy data, through bureaucratic labyrinths, through sandstorms in &quot;data centers&quot; made of tents and suitcases. Whatever it takes, we figure out how to do it.</p>\n\n<p>A team of analysts at a customer site might want training for a tool we&#39;ve built. One of our customers&#39; CEOs might need help convincing another organization to share data. A team of developers might be asking for direction on which of a dozen feature requests they should prioritize this quarter. Or a global financial organization might be on the line, reeling from a recent compliance failure and asking us what we can do to help detect and prevent such behavior in the future. These, and a hundred other everyday scenarios, are where a Deployment Strategist thrives.</p>\n\n<p>This role doesn&#39;t come neatly packaged or defined. You should expect it to change during your time at Statsopt, to evolve as our organization evolves and as you do. When we interview Deployment Strategists, we aren&#39;t looking for people with a specific background. We&#39;re looking for people with exceptional analytic ability, creative brilliance, technical aptitude, and a gift for finding the details that matter. Most of all, we&#39;re looking for people who combine a calling to leave the world better than they found it with the resourcefulness necessary to realize that calling, no matter the circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>If that sounds like you, then we&#39;re interested.</p>\n\n<p>We look forward to hearing from you. You can scroll down for more specific examples of roles Deployment Strategists might take on.<br> </p>\n \n\n<p style=\"color: rgb(119, 122, 122); font-size: 15px;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(16, 17, 19); display: block; font-family: blender,helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: 28px; text-align: center;\">PRODUCT OWNER</span></p>\n\n<p>We&#39;re constantly building products at Statsopt. Some products are very specific to particular customer workflows—specialized geospatial visualization tools, for example, that might exist as part of a more generic map application. Others, such as a lightweight document reader, are deployed to tens of thousands of our users. All of these products have their roots in a particular customer&#39;s needs, where a team of Deployment Strategists and Forward-Deployed Software Engineers sat down together with our core developers and started work.</p>\n\n<p>Deployment Strategists who gravitate towards product ownership have strong technical skills, compelling creative vision for what software can do, and an instinct for leadership. They apply those skills to leading a team that builds and supports a product: defining requirements, testing new versions, installing and configuring applications, sitting down with users and gathering feedback about what&#39;s working well and what isn&#39;t. They work across organizations and across internal teams, ensuring that we are all aligned on what we are building and why. Ultimately, they are responsible for ensuring that we deliver a product that truly transforms our customers&#39; ability to work with data.</p>\n\n<p style=\"color: rgb(119, 122, 122); font-size: 15px;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(16, 17, 19); display: block; font-family: blender,helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: 28px; text-align: center;\">PROJECT OWNER</span></p>\n\n<p>Our partnerships with our customers are at the core of what we do. Our customers trust that we are the best in the world at building and delivering enterprise software. They trust that we mean it when we say we can enable collaboration across a worldwide enterprise without sacrificing security, or that in the event of a crisis we will surge the team that supports them just as they surge their own internal team. Fundamentally, our customers—whether they&#39;re looking for a missing child, an insurgent assembling a roadside bomb, or the source of a cyber attack on their network—trust that we care as deeply about their problems as they do.</p>\n\n<p>Deployment Strategists who gravitate towards project ownership are the face of Statsopt, and the custodians of that trust. They pair a passion for software with excellent communication skills, an ability to navigate organizational hurdles, and an instinct for putting the right people in the right places. A project owner might spend the morning in meetings with customers to discuss the status of a data integration, the afternoon in a CTO&#39;s office talking about best practices in cyber security, and lunch in between at our headquarters brainstorming with a technical team about the best time to perform an upgrade. Ultimately, they are responsible for the strength of our partnerships: for ensuring that our customers are excited to work with us, and that we are excited to work with our customers.</p>\n\n<p style=\"color: rgb(119, 122, 122); font-size: 15px;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(16, 17, 19); display: block; font-family: blender,helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: 28px; text-align: center;\">PROCESS OWNER</span></p>\n\n<p>The common thread across all of our work is data—lots of data. Organizations come to us when they no longer know how to make sense of the data they wish to inform their decisions, and while there are always differences, large and small, between different customers&#39; workflows in our software, there are also many areas of overlap.</p>\n\n<p>Deployment Strategists who gravitate towards process ownership are experts in deploying software and making it work for human beings. They are brilliant, articulate, and generally deeply empathetic people. They excel at sitting down with a user and within minutes understanding exactly what he or she is trying to do--and at then synthesizing that understanding into a broader vision of what we can do to help them. That might mean building a new tool, or paring superfluous features out of an existing one. It might mean implementing certain standards in data curation or analysis. It might mean a series of training sessions, or the creation of an entirely new task force.

Can we build what they need quickly enough? Will we be able to deploy it in the right environment, to the right people? Working side by side with our Forward-Deployed Software Engineers, we refine our vision, and then find our way to it: through messy data, through bureaucratic labyrinths, through sandstorms in &quot;data centers&quot; made of tents and suitcases. Whatever it takes, we figure out how to do it.</p>\n\n<p>A team of analysts at a customer site might want training for a tool we&#39;ve built. One of our customers&#39; CEOs might need help convincing another organization to share data. A team of developers might be asking for direction on which of a dozen feature requests they should prioritize this quarter. Or a global financial organization might be on the line, reeling from a recent compliance failure and asking us what we can do to help detect and prevent such behavior in the future. These, and a hundred other everyday scenarios, are where a Deployment Strategist thrives.</p>\n\n<p>This role doesn&#39;t come neatly packaged or defined. You should expect it to change during your time at Statsopt, to evolve as our organization evolves and as you do. When we interview Deployment Strategists, we aren&#39;t looking for people with a specific background. We&#39;re looking for people with exceptional analytic ability, creative brilliance, technical aptitude, and a gift for finding the details that matter. Most of all, we&#39;re looking for people who combine a calling to leave the world better than they found it with the resourcefulness necessary to realize that calling, no matter the circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>If that sounds like you, then we&#39;re interested.</p>\n\n<p>We look forward to hearing from you. You can scroll down for more specific examples of roles Deployment Strategists might take on.<br> </p>\n \n\n<p style=\"color: rgb(119, 122, 122); font-size: 15px;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(16, 17, 19); display: block; font-family: blender,helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: 28px; text-align: center;\">PRODUCT OWNER</span></p>\n\n<p>We&#39;re constantly building products at Statsopt. Some products are very specific to particular customer workflows—specialized geospatial visualization tools, for example, that might exist as part of a more generic map application. Others, such as a lightweight document reader, are deployed to tens of thousands of our users. All of these products have their roots in a particular customer&#39;s needs, where a team of Deployment Strategists and Forward-Deployed Software Engineers sat down together with our core developers and started work.</p>\n\n<p>Deployment Strategists who gravitate towards product ownership have strong technical skills, compelling creative vision for what software can do, and an instinct for leadership. They apply those skills to leading a team that builds and supports a product: defining requirements, testing new versions, installing and configuring applications, sitting down with users and gathering feedback about what&#39;s working well and what isn&#39;t. They work across organizations and across internal teams, ensuring that we are all aligned on what we are building and why. Ultimately, they are responsible for ensuring that we deliver a product that truly transforms our customers&#39; ability to work with data.</p>\n\n<p style=\"color: rgb(119, 122, 122); font-size: 15px;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(16, 17, 19); display: block; font-family: blender,helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: 28px; text-align: center;\">PROJECT OWNER</span></p>\n\n<p>Our partnerships with our customers are at the core of what we do. Our customers trust that we are the best in the world at building and delivering enterprise software. They trust that we mean it when we say we can enable collaboration across a worldwide enterprise without sacrificing security, or that in the event of a crisis we will surge the team that supports them just as they surge their own internal team. Fundamentally, our customers—whether they&#39;re looking for a missing child, an insurgent assembling a roadside bomb, or the source of a cyber attack on their network—trust that we care as deeply about their problems as they do.</p>\n\n<p>Deployment Strategists who gravitate towards project ownership are the face of Statsopt, and the custodians of that trust. They pair a passion for software with excellent communication skills, an ability to navigate organizational hurdles, and an instinct for putting the right people in the right places. A project owner might spend the morning in meetings with customers to discuss the status of a data integration, the afternoon in a CTO&#39;s office talking about best practices in cyber security, and lunch in between at our headquarters brainstorming with a technical team about the best time to perform an upgrade. Ultimately, they are responsible for the strength of our partnerships: for ensuring that our customers are excited to work with us, and that we are excited to work with our customers.</p>\n\n<p style=\"color: rgb(119, 122, 122); font-size: 15px;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(16, 17, 19); display: block; font-family: blender,helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size: 28px; text-align: center;\">PROCESS OWNER</span></p>\n\n<p>The common thread across all of our work is data—lots of data. Organizations come to us when they no longer know how to make sense of the data they wish to inform their decisions, and while there are always differences, large and small, between different customers&#39; workflows in our software, there are also many areas of overlap.</p>\n\n<p>Deployment Strategists who gravitate towards process ownership are experts in deploying software and making it work for human beings. They are brilliant, articulate, and generally deeply empathetic people. They excel at sitting down with a user and within minutes understanding exactly what he or she is trying to do--and at then synthesizing that understanding into a broader vision of what we can do to help them. That might mean building a new tool, or paring superfluous features out of an existing one. It might mean implementing certain standards in data curation or analysis. It might mean a series of training sessions, or the creation of an entirely new task force. Whatever the solution, they will own it, and will ensure that our customers benefit fully from everything we&#39;ve learned over the last decade of helping humans to navigate data.</p>","website_job":"a2a80000000PYS3AAO"},"a0m80000002IiWkAAK":{"id":"a0m80000002IiWkAAK","website_url":"https://www.Statsopt.com/careers/OpenPosDetail?id=a0m80000002IiWk","published_id":"a0m80000002IiWk","label":"Forward Deployed Software Engineer - Australia","name":"Forward Deployed Software Engineer","publishing_category":"Business Development","physical_location":"Canberra, Australia","location":"Australia","description":"<p><b>What We Do</b></p>\n\n<p>Forward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) are responsible for the technical success of each of our deployments.

We begin with a vision: a vision of how software can transform people&#39;s relationship to data at the heart of a problem we care deeply about. We test that vision. Do our partners share it? Can we build what they need quickly enough? Will we be able to deploy it in the right environment, to the right people? Working side by side with our Forward-Deployed Software Engineers, we refine our vision, and then find our way to it: through messy data, through bureaucratic labyrinths, through sandstorms in &quot;data centers&quot; made of tents and suitcases. Whatever it takes, we figure out how to do it.</p>\n\n<p>A team of analysts at a customer site might want training for a tool we&#39;ve built. One of our customers&#39; CEOs might need help convincing another organization to share data. A team of developers might be asking for direction on which of a dozen feature requests they should prioritize this quarter. Or a global financial organization might be on the line, reeling from a recent compliance failure and asking us what we can do to help detect and prevent such behavior in the future. These, and a hundred other everyday scenarios, are where a Deployment Strategist thrives.</p>\n\n<p>This role doesn&#39;t come neatly packaged or defined. You should expect it to change during your time at Statsopt, to evolve as our organization evolves and as you do. When we interview Deployment Strategists, we aren&#39;t looking for people with a specific background.
