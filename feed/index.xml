      <description>&lt;p&gt;At Palantir, we make supporting the next generation of technologists a priority. We believe an important part of that mission is supporting a diverse group of people interested in technology, which is why we partner with organizations like &lt;a href=&quot;http://sheplusplus.org&quot;&gt;she++&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;At Palantir, we make supporting the next generation of technologists a priority. We believe an important part of that mission is supporting a diverse group of people interested in technology, which is why we partner with organizations like &lt;a href=&quot;http://sheplusplus.org&quot;&gt;she++&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, she++ launched the College Ambassadors Program to extend the organization’s reach to women across the country. Individual ambassadors are selected for their passion and commitment to creating a welcome and inclusive environment in the tech community. 40 total ambassadors were selected for a trip to the Bay Area, where they met with local tech companies. The College Ambassadors stopped by our headquarters in Palo Alto last week and attended the she++ gala on Friday night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the visit, we showed a demonstration of our philanthropy work to give them a taste of how we use technology to help solve some of the world’s hardest problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/build/images/blog/post-images/palantir-welcomes-she++/0P0A5224.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the demonstration, students met with Palantirians from our Women in Engineering group to discuss new applications for Palantir software. One idea that came up was how our software could help bring nutritious food options to low-income populations across the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That evening, Palantirians attended the she++ Gala at the Computer History Museum to support all the work she++ is doing and the projects that the Ambassadors have taken on to improve technology education in their local communities across the nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/build/images/blog/post-images/palantir-welcomes-she++/0P0A5380.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Palantir is proud to support the next generation of #goodgirlsgonegeek!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Scholarship for Women in Engineering</title>
      <link>https://palantir.com/2015/03/scholarship-for-women-in-engineering</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At Palantir, our mission is to find or develop solutions for the world’s hardest problems. Since 2010, our annual scholarship has helped us discover and reward students doing just that. Our scholarship is now targeted towards undergraduate women and sponsored by our Women in Engineering group. This year, from a record pool of applicants, we chose nine finalists who we believe represent the best of what women in technology have to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;At Palantir, our mission is to find or develop solutions for the world’s hardest problems. Since 2010, our annual scholarship has helped us discover and reward students doing just that. Our scholarship is now targeted towards undergraduate women and sponsored by our Women in Engineering group. This year, from a record pool of applicants, we chose nine finalists who we believe represent the best of what women in technology have to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our 2014 finalists’ projects solved disparate problems and incorporated principles from dozens of areas of study. The projects, which included everything from using blackberry juice to power streetlamps to developing an eco-friendly clothing dye, are focused on improving the way people around the world live and work. Some focus on improving the efficiency of small communities, like an application to help local government officials prioritize the needs of their community. Others help improve response to international crises, like an SMS-based platform to track global health epidemics or the enhancement of robotic vehicles to improve disaster response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scholarship-finalists&quot;&gt;2014–2015 Scholarship Finalists&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elana Stroud&lt;/strong&gt;, Computer Science and Design, Johns Hopkins University&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Priyanka Sekhar&lt;/strong&gt;, Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, Stanford University&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nina Lu&lt;/strong&gt;, Computer Science and Economics, University of Pennsylvania&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah Cen&lt;/strong&gt;, Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Princeton University&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyndy Marie Ejanda&lt;/strong&gt;, Computer Science and Mathematics, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lillian Tsai&lt;/strong&gt;, Computer Science and Mathematics, Harvard University&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yiguang Zhang&lt;/strong&gt;, Applied Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science, Johns Hopkins University&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alexandra Berges&lt;/strong&gt;, Biomedical Engineering and Computer Science, Johns Hopkins University&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nicole Chernavsky&lt;/strong&gt;, Bioengineering, University of California, Berkeley&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After multiple rounds of application reviews and interviews, we chose this year’s winner: Johns Hopkins sophomore Elana Stroud. Elana is majoring in Computer Science and Design and built an application that allows local officials to crowdsource information about their constituents’ priorities. This allows them to more effectively allocate scarce city resources. Elana chose the project because she was motived to help her adopted city of Baltimore govern more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;on-site-visit&quot;&gt;On-Site Visit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We invited these women to join us at our Palo Alto headquarters for a day of interviews, a tour and demonstration with Palantirians, and a few tastes of our notoriously delicious food. In the morning, finalists had interviews with Palantirians across the business focused on their academic backgrounds and scholarship projects. Once the hard part was over, finalists chatted with us on topics including preparing for life after college; how to make the most out of job interviews; and  when to speak up, raise awareness, get involved, and improve the atmosphere for women in academia and industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/build/images/blog/post-images/scholarship-for-women-in-engineering/0P0A2431.jpg&quot; /&gt;
The finalists had breakfast with members of our engineering team in Hobbit House, our company-wide dining area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/build/images/blog/post-images/scholarship-for-women-in-engineering/0P0A2445.jpg&quot; /&gt;
The day’s tour included a walk through our office space, gardens, and the Design Studio (shown above), where they saw mockups of our front-end user interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/build/images/blog/post-images/scholarship-for-women-in-engineering/0P0A2462.jpg&quot; /&gt;
The finalists were treated to Chef’s Table, a gourmet tasting menu prepared by our Sous Chef, Kali Mulligan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/build/images/blog/post-images/scholarship-for-women-in-engineering/0P0A2531.jpg&quot; /&gt;
Angela Muller, one of our Forward Deployed Engineers, talked to the finalists about her experiences as a woman in the tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/build/images/blog/post-images/scholarship-for-women-in-engineering/0P0A2566.jpg&quot; /&gt;
The finalists had a “Fireside Chat” with a variety of Palantirians, who provided their perspectives on school and what happens after graduation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is always our hope that hosting the finalists provides two-way value. We aim to show the finalists that their projects are just the beginning of their impact: women in technology are continuously working to make the world a better place. The finalists’ passion for the problems they are solving and their novel insights inspire us to expand the way we solve the world’s most intractable problems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Housing Homeless Veterans with Palantir Homelink</title>
      <link>https://palantir.com/2015/01/housing-homeless-veterans-with-palantir-homelink</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is estimated that on any given night, 50,000 veterans are homeless in the United States, including over 12,000 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans.  For homeless veterans across the U.S., the process of finding permanent housing can be difficult and slow.  Homeless service providers struggle to meet the complicated federal and local requirements for funding and housing, and legacy databases are siloed and outdated.  Veterans end up bouncing between various organizations, filling out dozens of forms, and sitting on housing waiting lists for up to 300 days.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It is estimated that on any given night, 50,000 veterans are homeless in the United States, including over 12,000 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans.  For homeless veterans across the U.S., the process of finding permanent housing can be difficult and slow.  Homeless service providers struggle to meet the complicated federal and local requirements for funding and housing, and legacy databases are siloed and outdated.  Veterans end up bouncing between various organizations, filling out dozens of forms, and sitting on housing waiting lists for up to 300 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last summer, we partnered with &lt;a href=&quot;http://cmtysolutions.org/&quot;&gt;Community Solutions&lt;/a&gt; to help homeless veterans find housing faster in cities across the U.S.  We developed a pilot program with San Francisco through an iterative design process where our team shadowed homeless service providers at work in the city and learned about the housing match process from highly experienced non-profit and city government partners.  We then tested a range of design and workflow concepts in consultation with these partners, resulting in our “Homelink” tool.  Homelink is a secure, user-friendly platform for cities and non-profits to assess, track, and match veterans to housing within a single interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continued to develop features and polish the design of Homelink as we kicked off our pilot with San Francisco in October, with users from San Francisco non-profit organizations, city government agencies, and the San Francisco Department of Veteran Affairs.  Based on feedback from this pilot phase, including multiple on-site visits to these various homeless service providers, we have continued to develop Homelink and were able to launch a new expansion to the city of Nashville in December 2014 to help them end veteran and chronic homelessness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, we plan to scale Homelink to 10 additional cities across the U.S., empowering them to get veterans and chronic homeless throughout their communities matched to housing quickly and easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our partnering organizations in San Francisco is the non-profit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.swords-to-plowshares.org/&quot;&gt;Swords to Plowshares&lt;/a&gt;, which is using Homelink to speed up the matching process with their veteran clients in the San Francisco area. Check out the brief video below to hear Paul Howard from Community Solutions and Dave Lopez from Swords to Plowshares talk about the problem of veterans homelessness and how they see Palantir helping to get veterans matched to housing:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With much of the US focusing on the dinner table at Thanksgiving, we at Palantir wanted to share a video about our work helping &lt;a href=&quot;/2012/10/grameen-foundation-palantir-partners-for-food-security/&quot;&gt;Grameen Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and other partner organizations use data to alleviate food insecurity and improve livelihoods for smallholder farmers around the world. Improving these farmers’ lives represents one of the world’s most important problems, as over two billion people make their living from agriculture, and smallholder farmers making up 70% of the world’s extreme poor. Watch the video below to see how our technology is helping our partners better target products and services to improve farmers’ productivity and sustainability, optimize farming practices to improve crop yields, and invest in services that work through more effective program monitoring &amp;amp; evaluation. It is critical for organizations working in the space to use data effectively in order to support these outcomes, and we are looking forward to building on this body of work in 2015 to continue to support our partners’ excellent work around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>C4ADS helps East African authorities and local NGOs seize over $10MM in illicit environmental goods</title>
      <link>https://palantir.com/2014/11/c4ads-helps-east-african-authorities-and-local-ngos-seize-over-10mm-in-illicit-environmental-goods</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Throughout 2014, our partners at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.c4ads.org/&quot;&gt;C4ADS&lt;/a&gt; have been using Palantir Gotham to &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/following-the-ivory/&quot;&gt;uncover illicit networks&lt;/a&gt; involved in elephant poaching and the lucrative illegal ivory trade. C4ADS has integrated and analyzed open source data to shine a light on transnational networks trafficking in elephant ivory and other illegal environmental goods, while working with a coalition of NGOs, government partners, and private corporations. As an example of direct impact from this work, C4ADS’ analysis recently helped East African authorities identify a likely illicit shipment, leading to the seizure of at least $11 million in illegal environmental goods and making for one of the largest environmental crime seizures in African history.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Throughout 2014, our partners at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.c4ads.org/&quot;&gt;C4ADS&lt;/a&gt; have been using Palantir Gotham to &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/following-the-ivory/&quot;&gt;uncover illicit networks&lt;/a&gt; involved in elephant poaching and the lucrative illegal ivory trade. C4ADS has integrated and analyzed open source data to shine a light on transnational networks trafficking in elephant ivory and other illegal environmental goods, while working with a coalition of NGOs, government partners, and private corporations. As an example of direct impact from this work, C4ADS’ analysis recently helped East African authorities identify a likely illicit shipment, leading to the seizure of at least $11 million in illegal environmental goods and making for one of the largest environmental crime seizures in African history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video below was recorded by C4ADS to show how they use Palantir to piece together disparate data sets to build out an understanding of organizations involved in shipping ivory. The data they use includes open source maritime shipping data, African and Asian business directories, court records, and customs documentation. When integrated into a unified platform, C4ADS is able to use this data to find trends and uncover networks that otherwise might not be apparent to authorities. We are proud to support C4ADS’ impactful work, especially building off their work last year on the ‘&lt;a href=&quot;/2013/11/c4ads-and-the-odessa-network-understanding-illicit-networks-using-palantir-gotham/&quot;&gt;Odessa Network&lt;/a&gt;,’ which led the Greek coastguard to &lt;a href=&quot;/philanthropy-engineering/annual-report/&quot;&gt;seize 59 shipping containers of small arms&lt;/a&gt; en route from Ukraine to Syria. Stay tuned for more from C4ADS as their investigations progress, and we hope to have more news to share soon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Analyzing 10 Years of Commitments with the Clinton Global Initiative</title>
      <link>https://palantir.com/2014/10/analyzing-10-years-of-commitments-with-the-clinton-global-initiative</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In September, the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) celebrated its 10th Annual Meeting.  Since 2005, more than 3,100 Commitments to Action have been made, improving the lives of over 430 million people.  These commitments are dedicated to a range of key issues around the world, including Disaster Relief and Recovery, Global Health, Women/Girls, and Clean Energy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In September, the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) celebrated its 10th Annual Meeting.  Since 2005, more than 3,100 Commitments to Action have been made, improving the lives of over 430 million people.  These commitments are dedicated to a range of key issues around the world, including Disaster Relief and Recovery, Global Health, Women/Girls, and Clean Energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help CGI understand and evaluate this large volume of commitment work, Palantir donated our software to CGI and brought their last nine years of data into the platform along with 20 datasets on various global indicators (such as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators&quot;&gt;World Bank’s Development Indicators&lt;/a&gt;). CGI analysts then used Palantir to examine commitments across time, by country, by number of partners, topic area, and a number of other categories. This analysis enabled CGI to better assess which commitments have been effective, which haven’t, and what areas members could be doing more to address. The CGI team then drew a number of important conclusions that will help shape the direction of commitments made in the future.  For example, the team noticed the high success rate of commitments built on multi-sector partnerships, such as those between NGOs and corporations, as well as the growing importance of information technology as a component of commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This video clip, which aired at the CGI Annual Meeting, briefly summarizes our work together and its importance to CGI in planning for the future:&lt;/p&gt;

These interviews, to assess core skills necessary for a successful career at Palantir, remain at the heart of our hiring process. But as our company and products have evolved, so has the range of skills we need in candidates. We’ve recently added a decomposition interview to our slate, and, &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/12/the-ui-design-interview/&quot;&gt;as we’ve done&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/2012/09/how-to-rock-a-phone-interview/&quot;&gt;in the past&lt;/a&gt;, we’re going to go ahead and offer some tips for how to do well in this portion of your Palantir interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-decomp&quot;&gt;What is Decomp?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short for ‘decomposition of problems,’ the decomp interview helps us get a sense of how well you’re able to break down a problem into its nitty-gritty components, before the actual nitty-gritty building begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software engineering problems we encounter are often nebulous and complex, and require engineers who can break them down, develop a reasonable first-pass solution, and independently take steps to execute that solution. Decomp is a collaborative process – it might involve some coding or sketching out of what the code may look like. But most often, it involves whiteboarding and brainstorming with another dev to talk through the potential feature set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reflects what working at Palantir is actually like. Engineers have a tremendous amount of freedom here; our devs aren’t given features described to full specifications simply to implement. Rather, our customers typically give us an idea of what they think they need, but don’t know how to explain fully or build themselves. Since our work is constantly evolving, decomp is essential for all of our devs to be able to strategically assess the work that lies ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need people we can trust to do the right thing without a lot of supervision—people who can own large projects and take them consistently in the right direction. Invariably, this means being able to communicate well with the people around you. Decomp boils down to being able to see and do the right thing. We want to see if you can take nebulous requirements and translate them into something actionable. The result might be a complex, well-scoped system, or just a basic solution that solves a particular need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interviews&quot;&gt;Interviews&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decomp questions tend to be about designing a system or feature. We are looking for you to break down the problem, identify potential roadblocks, and develop a solution. From there, you’ll be having the same kind of conversation with your interviewer as you might have with a colleague in a planning meeting. This means that you’ll be shaping the discussion and the problem space. Some tips:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ask clarifying questions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make a sketch so that you understand the system&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Write a list of pros and cons for a given approach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In imitation of the collaborative environment at Palantir, your interviewer might suggest alternatives to your solution or point out problematic areas, looking for you to adjust or defend your course of action. Since there are many tradeoffs in any system we design, your interviewer will prod at your approach – don’t be afraid to defend elements that you feel are better than the alternative! But you should also be prepared to accept and incorporate a different implementation than what you had initially envisioned; flexibility is key in good decomp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;try-this-at-home&quot;&gt;Try This At Home!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to prepare for a decomp interview is to try it out yourself. There is really no substitute for practice, here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pick an open source project that interests you and figure out how you would design it. Bonus points if you then look at the real-world implementation and see what tradeoffs the authors decided to make.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Grab a coworker or classmate and try to do a design session with them. They should be involved in the session as well – together, the two of you should come up with the best solution possible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pick a problem and think through all of ways a solution might fail. What if there are hundreds of users? Millions of files? Tons of data? Building the intuition around how to suss out scale constraints will help you approach decomp in a structured way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;just-in-case&quot;&gt;Just In Case…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope this post has given you a good idea of what to expect and what to prepare for in your decomp interview. But just in case, here are a few pointers on what to avoid:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Indecisiveness: We know it’s tempting to spend a long time considering many different paths of problem solving, or to defer to someone else to bear the impact of making decisions. But being unable to decide on a plan of action, or being unable to support your decisions, is not particularly valuable, and can slow the entire project down.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stubbornness: On the other hand, if you’re unwilling to be open to new design ideas, that can be a red flag. At Palantir, we believe the best idea wins. Decomp is often a healthy balance of supporting your own work while still listening to input from others.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creating solutions in a vacuum: a perfect solution is very nice, but often impractical. If your solution doesn’t have a clear context, it’s not going to be useful.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unconstrained problem solving: Your interviewer is going to present an extremely broad problem – way too broad to tackle in its entirety in a 30-minute interview. Focus on the aspects that are most interesting to you, and avoid getting lost in the weeds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mapping the Global Ivory Poaching Supply Chain with C4ADS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past year, the Washington, DC-based non-profit C4ADS has been using Palantir to investigate elephant poaching and ivory trafficking, an illicit trade that is at its highest level in 25 years. Their new report, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.c4ads.org/#!project-highlights/c21l1&quot;&gt;Out of Africa: Mapping the Global Trade in Illicit Elephant Ivory&lt;/a&gt;, reveals how &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nbcnews.com/news/investigations/ivory-atrocity-asian-african-crime-groups-speed-elephant-slaughter-n189236&quot;&gt;specific criminal groups in Asia and Africa sustain the ivory trade&lt;/a&gt; and identifies common routes and potential bottlenecks in international transport, such as major shipping ports that ivory is likely to pass through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not the first time C4ADS has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/ukrainian-port-eyed-as-analysts-seek-syrias-arms-source/2013/09/07/f61b0082-1710-11e3-a2ec-b47e45e6f8ef_story.html&quot;&gt;made headline news&lt;/a&gt;. Last year, C4ADS gained recognition after its researchers used Palantir to &lt;a href=&quot;/2013/11/c4ads-and-the-odessa-network-understanding-illicit-networks-using-palantir-gotham/&quot;&gt;investigate a network of commercial ships trafficking arms into Syria&lt;/a&gt; from Ukraine. Since then, C4ADS has continued to use Palantir Gotham as their analytical system to investigate illicit networks across the world. Elephant poaching and ivory trafficking is another aspect of C4ADS’ work, and it shows novel insights into how such activities are used to fund organized crime and terrorist and insurgent actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By integrating and analyzing information from disparate sources into Palantir, including data on ivory seizures, armed conflict, maritime shipping routes, and local socioeconomic factors, C4ADS was able to release their first report back in April. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://media.wix.com/ugd/e16b55_7ccc46650a664e47b09709c97bc94933.pdf&quot;&gt;Ivory’s Curse: The Militarization &amp;amp; Professionalization of Poaching in Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; explored how elephant poaching is &lt;a href=&quot;http://bigstory.ap.org/article/apnewsbreak-africa-land-grabs-endanger-elephants&quot;&gt;inextricably tied to regional violence&lt;/a&gt;, as the black market for ivory generates cash for insurgents, militaries, and transnational organized crime. C4ADS analysts used Palantir to identify protected areas in Africa that appear to be at particularly high risk for armed conflict due to ivory poaching, and profiled seven separate regional case studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-assets/posts/2014/09/C4ADS-pic-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Using armed conflict data weighted by number of casualties, C4ADS examines how conflict in the DRC is clustered around numerous elephant ranges.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following this analysis, C4ADS used Palantir to collect detailed information on ivory seizures and build out a picture of the networks of individuals and commercial organizations connected to consolidating, shipping, selling, and purchasing ivory. They showed, for instance, how much of the illegal ivory being sold is laundered through the legal ivory market in China, which has the largest market for both legal and illegal ivory in the world. &lt;a href=&quot;http://media.wix.com/ugd/e16b55_7bcdf1969edd42079e913e6f180aba8d.pdf&quot;&gt;According to the report&lt;/a&gt;, Chinese traffickers are instrumental in nearly every stage of the supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By shining a light on how exactly ivory is transported from elephant ranges in Africa to points of sale in Southeast Asia, C4ADS hopes that they can help authorities identify vulnerabilities in the ivory supply chain and better focus their resources. They also hope that this work will help the international community see how ivory poaching, far from being simply a conservation issue, is directly tied to highly militarized armed groups and professional, transnational criminal syndicates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The below infographic summarizes some of the insights from C4ADS’ latest report. For additional details on C4ADS’ work, be sure to see the Illicit Networks section of last year’s &lt;a href=&quot;/philanthropy-engineering/annual-report/&quot;&gt;Philanthropy Engineering Annual Report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Analyzing the Present and Possible Futures of the U.S. Veterans Population with CNAS and Palantir Metropolis</title>
      <link>https://palantir.com/2014/08/analyzing-the-present-and-possible-futures-of-the-us-veterans-population-with-cnas-and-palantir-metropolis</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The U.S. veteran population includes more than 21 million men and women who have served their country in uniform, ranging from veterans of the “greatest generation” who fought in World War II to veterans completing their first enlistment.  Within this population are 6 million “Gulf War-era” veterans who were part of, or have served since, the first Gulf conflict in the early 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The U.S. veteran population includes more than 21 million men and women who have served their country in uniform, ranging from veterans of the “greatest generation” who fought in World War II to veterans completing their first enlistment.  Within this population are 6 million “Gulf War-era” veterans who were part of, or have served since, the first Gulf conflict in the early 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The available data on veterans is scattered, inconsistent, and in differing formats. This is a major challenge for the government agencies and NGOs that seek to serve veterans, as they often have to plan how to dedicate financial and human resources across a wide geography, and plan for major projects and facilities years in advance.  Veterans service organizations often struggle to connect with veterans because they lack data relevant to the geographic areas they serve. With the help of Palantir Metropolis, researchers from the DC-based think tank Center for a New American Security (CNAS) are analyzing the present veterans populations and developing projections to understand the possible future paths of this population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Center for a New American Security (CNAS) is the only think tank of its kind with a research team dedicated to veterans and military personnel.  To better understand the current veterans population and its changing needs, this team is using the Palantir Metropolis platform to fuse a multitude of publicly available datasets from various government agencies, including U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the Census Bureau, the Department of Defense, and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). These public datasets consist solely in high-level, aggregated data and can be accessed through government agency websites including the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.census.gov/hhes/veterans/&quot;&gt;Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.va.gov/vetdata/veteran_population.asp&quot;&gt;VA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://open.defense.gov/Data.aspx&quot;&gt;DOD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.onecpd.info/resource/3300/2013-ahar-part-1-pit-estimates-of-homelessness/&quot;&gt;HUD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the CNAS Annual Conference in June, senior fellow &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnas.org/CarterPhillip&quot;&gt;Phil Carter&lt;/a&gt; presented a number of findings from this initiative and discussed their implications for veterans policy going forward. (Full video of presentation available &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnas.org/video/cnas2014/visualizing-todays-vets-population-phillip-carter&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in 2015, Gulf-war era veterans will overtake Vietnam veterans as the largest segment of the veteran population; with this shift comes a new set of concerns for the Department of Veterans Affairs and other government agencies tasked with serving veterans.  Instead of retirement and geriatric care, younger veterans seek employment and rehabilitative sports medicine.  They often have young families, are more diverse racially and by gender, and are more likely to move to cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the current veteran populations is most heavily concentrated in the Sunbelt regions of the south and southwestern United States, reflecting a primarily retirement-age population, as seen in the map below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, employment opportunities in urban areas, near military bases, or related to specific events like the American energy boom are likely to attract younger veterans and shift this population significantly in coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of analysis can also help illuminate the situation for veterans in more specific areas and enables better planning by the VA and veterans service organizations.  In the wake of the recent problems with VA waiting lists at facilities in Phoenix, AZ, for example, CNAS looked at Arizona counties by veterans population and VA spending to better understand the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-assets/posts/2014/08/AZmaps.png&quot; title=&quot;Absolute and per capita veteran population and veteran benefit spending in Arizona&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top two maps show the Arizona veterans population by county in absolute numbers (top left) and per capita (top right), as well as the amount spent by the VA annually in these counties (GDX) in absolute terms (bottom left) and per capita (bottom right).  These maps are interesting because in both cases the absolute highest number of veterans and highest amount of money spent is, unsurprisingly, in Maricopa County, where Phoenix is located.  However, a more complicated picture emerges when looking at per capita population and spending, where Maricopa County is no longer the highest.  The wide disparity between per-veteran spending figures suggests a number of potential conclusions, including huge economies of scale for serving urban veterans, and concentrations of high-need veterans in rural areas where it may be most expensive for the VA to serve them. Further analysis of this kind is necessary to understand what’s really going on in Phoenix VA facilities and how to better allocate resources and plan for the future care of veterans in those facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the conclusion of the conference presentation, CNAS débuted the first Palantir Metropolis dashboards to ever be completely public-facing, with no log-in required.  They invited fellow researchers, policy makers, and veterans to join their effort to use veterans data to conduct better analysis and make better policy decisions for the future of America’s veterans and the government agencies that serve them.&lt;/p&gt;
